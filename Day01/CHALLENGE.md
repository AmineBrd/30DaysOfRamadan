Sample 1:

| Input | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 4 |76|
|4 8|101|
|2 13|105|
|14 5|96|
|8 8  | |

### Explanation:

 - **Test case 111**: King has 444 cars that seat 555 each and 888 cars that seat 777 each. So,  4×5+8×7=76people can travel together.

 - **Test case 222**: King has 222 cars that seat 555 each and 131313 cars that seat 777 each. So, 2×5+13×7=101 people can travel together.

 - **Test case 333**: King has 141414 cars that seat 555 each and 555 cars that seat 777 each. So,14×5+7×7=105 people can travel together.

 - **Test case 444**: King has 888 cars that seat 555 each and 888 cars that seat 777 each. So, 8×5+8×7=96 people can travel together.
